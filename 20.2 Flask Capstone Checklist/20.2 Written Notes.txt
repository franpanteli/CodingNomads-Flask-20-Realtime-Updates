-> flask capstone checklist  
    -> this checklist outlines the requirements for your flask capstone project to ensure you meet the graduation standard for course completion  

-> overarching flask project requirements  
    -> your capstone should be a flask web app with a fresh, custom design  
    -> do not reuse code from earlier course projects  
    -> the project must be created in a separate github repository  
    -> the repository must include a readme file explaining how to set up, run, and use the project  
    -> ensure your project features clean, organised code and thorough documentation  

-> application factory/blueprints  
    -> fully functional user interface (ui)  
        -> allow users to register, log in, and use the app  
        -> ensure all buttons and links are functional  
        -> ensure images and resources load correctly  
    -> unified user interface design  
        -> consistent navigation, headers, etc., across all pages  
        -> consistent css styling (bootstrap, custom, or other)  

-> flask-sqlalchemy extension  
    -> the application must use a database (other than sqlite) with properly modelled relationships  

-> flask-login extension  
    -> users must be able to create accounts and log in (ensure password hashing is implemented)  
    -> include several user profiles with different authorisation levels (e.g., guest, user, admin)  

-> api  
    -> the application must function as a restful api  
        -> should support get and post operations for most objects/data models  

-> exception/error handling  
    -> implement a custom error handler and error pages  

-> deployment  
    -> the project should be deployed and accessible on a platform of your choice (e.g., heroku, aws, azure)  

-> create a capstone project readme  
    -> your readme should provide a clear description of your project  
        -> include detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and use the project  
    -> a well-written readme is essential, especially if you plan to showcase the project to potential employers  

-> summary  
    -> flask capstone project checklist overview:  
        -> custom, fresh flask web app design  
        -> a separate github repository with a readme  
        -> organised code and abundant documentation  
        -> must include technical elements:  
            -> application factory/blueprints  
            -> flask-sqlalchemy extension  
            -> flask-login extension  
            -> api functionality  
            -> exception/error handling  
            -> deployment  

    -> now you're ready to start building your flask capstone project! utilise the resources available to create a project that you're truly proud of
